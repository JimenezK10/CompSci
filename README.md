# My Computer Science Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is where I document my journey as a computer science student. Here, you'll find projects from my coursework and personal endeavors, showcasing my growth and learning in various aspects of computer science.

## About Me

I am a computer science student with a passion for developing applications and solving problems through code. My journey so far includes coursework in Python scripting, Java application development, and SQL databases. I am currently diving into Statistics for STEM, utilizing Python and Jupyter notebooks.

## Courses and Projects

### 1. Intro to Scripting (Python)
In this course, I learned the basics of Python programming, including variables, data types, control structures, functions, and basic data structures. Here are some of the projects and scripts I developed:
- **Project 1**: [Description coming soon]
- **Project 2**: [Description coming soon]

### 2. Intro to Application Development (Java)
This course introduced me to object-oriented programming with Java. I developed several applications, focusing on principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Project 1**: [Description coming soon]
- **Project 2**: [Description coming soon]

### 3. Intro to Structured Databases (SQL)
In this course, I learned about relational databases, SQL queries, and database design. I created and managed databases, performing complex queries to retrieve and manipulate data.
- **Project 1**: [Description coming soon]
- **Project 2**: [Description coming soon]

### 4. Statistics for STEM (Python and Jupyter Notebooks)
Currently, I am exploring statistics and its applications in STEM fields. This course involves extensive use of Python and Jupyter notebooks to analyze and visualize data.
- **Project 1**: [Description coming soon]
- **Project 2**: [Description coming soon]

## Future Plans
As I continue my studies, I plan to delve deeper into areas such as machine learning, web development, and advanced database systems. This repository will be regularly updated with new projects and learnings.
